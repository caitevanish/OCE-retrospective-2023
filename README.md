# OCE-website-v2015

## Background
Organized Creative Environments, or OCE, was a passion project of mine from 2015-2019. OCE was a business and web project I started in 2015, and again in 2018. 

The services I offered were home/office/studio organization and creating bespoke file systems to streamline the daily operations in artist and creative professionals' lives. 
The goal of the website was to inform creatives of my services, provide contact information, and serve as a platform/blog for my writings, art work, and projects.

I was rich with ideas, however during this time I was not equipped with web development skills. The content, designs, and progress I had made came to a halt. 

Until now...

### Return to 2015

During the early days of this project, I was a firehose of ideas and creative direction... perhaps, too much? I had flourished in the ideation phase and was excellent at structuring my assets in my work files. Over time, I updated these files and folders, but what remains is a creative time capsule; a project frozen in time and digital purgatory.

### Objective
This project is a return to the OCE web designs created in 2015.

I will be creating the home page, using the original digital assets and content written at the time. It will probably be confusing, embarrassing, and tacky, but it will get it's day on the web!
